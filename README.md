# Networking-coursework

This networking assignment is a part of the **Computer Networks** course taken during my undergraduation. It was supervised by [Dr. Mahfuzulhoq Chowdhury](https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/Mahfuzulhoq-Chowdhury-2105068852). 

### Objective

To implement the following task scheduling algorithm in a cloud computing environment for (a) Different arrival time and (b) All requests arriving at once.

1. FCFS - First Come First Serve
2. SJF - Shortest Job First
3. LJF - Longest Job First
4. EDF - Earliest Deadline First 
5. Random Assignment
